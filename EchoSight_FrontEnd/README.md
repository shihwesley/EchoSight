# Client Side Application

This is the client side of our full stack mobile web application. It is built using React.js and communicates with the server side through API calls.

## Getting Started

To get started with the client side application, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the `client` directory.
2. Start the application by running `npm start`.

## Structure

The client side application is structured as follows:

- `src/App.js`: This is the main JavaScript file for the client-side application. It includes the main App component which serves as the root of your component hierarchy.
- `src/index.js`: This is the JavaScript file that bootstraps the client-side application. It includes calls to render the root App component.
- `src/components`: This directory contains all the React components used in the client-side application.
- `src/assets`: This directory contains all the static files like images, fonts etc used in the client-side application.

## Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains environment variables for the client-side application. Be sure to update this file with your specific values.
